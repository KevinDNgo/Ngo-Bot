Welcome to Ngo Bot
==================
This bot was originally created to address the hassle of manually deleting commands and responses related to FredBoat, a popular Discord music bot. The ultimate goal of this bot is to provide extended administrator privileges for Discord server hosts.

How it was made
---------------
The code is being hosted live on Glitch. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

Find out more [about Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).

The main code is in `server.js`
Frameworks and packages are in `package.json`

Future plans
------------
I want to create a tool that grants Discord server administrators access to extended user logs. For example, I want administrators to be able to see when users last joined the voice call.
